// The quality of your work speaks for itself. Yes, the mock-up was reproduced, but your codebase was elegant and you added your own personal flare and touch which was super great to see. You were able to provide a clean consistent story of your work. But mainly, the way you compartmentalized your logic, questions and scores into your JS folder shows you understand modularization and organization of your codebase! <<Something unique about the assignment>>.
// Coding is not just a science, but an art as well. Well done making sure your code is readable, sustainable and reusable!

// Now, <<student name>>, you created a unique name for your repository, and you were able to follow best practices for the file structure and naming conventions.
